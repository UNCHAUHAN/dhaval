 HTML
 =====

 HTML is a standard to present data on the web. The HTML "standard" is also
 known as "HTML Specification" and it is denoted by number. e.g. HTML 4, HTML  5. This specification is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium - W3C -  a committee which maintain the "standards" for web technologies - HTML,   XHTML, XML, CSS, MathML, SVG and so on.

 Web-browers
 ========
 The web-browser also called "User-agents". It is the most complex software
 in our computer. The web-browser is comprises of number of software modules  including:
   
   1. HTML parsers -- Implementation of HTML,XHTML, XML standards and
                      it parses, validates,verify and creates HTML object of                        each markup (tag).
                      The "Parser" creates HTML object for each <tag> and
                      text (content) - It is known as "DOM - Document Object
                      Model".

                      [Start Developer Tool for more information. Chrome &
                       Mozilla - CTRL+SHIFT+I. IE - press F12]
   2. CSS Modules -- Once DOMs are created, the CSS Modules - color, 			animation, layout and others attach stylesheet 			properties to the DOMs.
   3. JavaScript Engine -- It is JavaScript runtime environment to execute
			JavaScript code.
   4. Graphics Engine -- It is the "graphics software" in the web-browser
			which render (paint) content on the body including 
                        text, images, video, audio and many more.

  [Most browsers are created using C/C++ programming languages & C/C++ libs]

 CSS
 ====

 CSS - Cascading Stylesheet is an instruction to the web-browser to "style"        the DOM.

 CSS Properties -- CSS property is "name: value" pair and terminated by 		   semi-colon.
 CSS Selectors -- They are building block of CSS. The Selector is a group 		name under which we can set one or more CSS properties.       

             e.g.
     /* Tag selector */
     body {
       color: #de3;
       font-size: 2em;
     }

   Properties are case-sensitive. There are different kinds of "selectors"    including :

           1. Tag selector
           2. ID selector
           3. Class selector
           4. Child selector
           5. Children selector (Descedent)
           6. Sibling selector
           7. Pseudo selector
   
   
   JavaScript
   ==========
   This is most misunderstood programing language in the world. It exists    everywhere -- It is the only language to write & execute program on
   web-browser.

   Application  of JavaScript
   -------------------------------
   1. Create, Update, Remove DOMs programatically.
   2. Set/Reset CSS properties programaticlaly.
   3. Model the data in form of class, super-class, objects, etc
   4. Handle "events" of DOMs.
   5. Background request system - called Asynchronious JavaScript And XML 				 (AJAX)
   6. JavaScript is pure-object oriented programming language and it is used
      for developing client applications. However, the JavaScript is also
      used to develop "Server-applications (it replaces PHP,ASP.NET etc)".       The NodeJS server-environment is for "server-side" JavaScript.
   7. Validating user input/selection etc.
